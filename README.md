# Home-Price-Prediction-Model
A machine learning model that predicts condo sale prices in Boston using multiple regression models!

## Description
Predicting condo sale prices in Boston using multiple regression models.

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the sale price of condos in Boston based on real estate data sourced from an MA MLS search. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and age of the property. The models used for prediction include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## 🏠 About This Model
This **Home Price Prediction Model** is designed to estimate real estate prices based on historical sales data and property features. While this specific implementation was trained using **condo sales data from Boston**, the model structure is flexible and can be easily **adapted for predicting house prices** by incorporating relevant variables like lot size, number of floors, and detached vs. attached homes.

If applied to single-family homes or other property types, **adjustments to feature selection** and **data preprocessing** may be necessary for optimal accuracy.

## Dataset: MLS Data 1.29.25.csv

**Source**: Massachusetts MLS Search  

### Search Criteria Used:
- **Property Type**: Condos (CC)  
- **Timeframe**: Last 2 years  
- **Towns Included**:  
  - Boston: Allston, Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Brighton, Charlestown, Chinatown, East Boston, Jamaica Plain, Leather District, Midtown, North End, Seaport District, South Boston, South End, The Fenway, Waterfront, West End  
- **Advanced Criteria**:  
  - Number of Bedrooms: 0-3  
  - Number of Total Baths: 1+  

## Key Features
- **SALE_PRICE**: Final sale price of the condo.  
- **SQUARE_FEET**: Total square footage.  
- **NO_BEDROOMS**: Number of bedrooms.  
- **YEAR_BUILT**: Year the condo was constructed.  
- **ZIP_CODE**: Location of the condo.  
- **BTH_DESC**: Description of full and half bathrooms.  
- **GARAGE_SPACES_CC**: Number of garage spaces.  

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Outlier Detection & Removal**: Identified outliers based on price per square foot (PPSF) using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Converted year built into home age, extracted full and half baths from `BTH_DESC`, and applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.  
3. **Data Scaling**: Standardized numerical features like square footage and home age.  
4. **Luxury Classification**: Defined top 10% of condos by PPSF as "Luxury" for better model differentiation.  

## Machine Learning Models
1. **Random Forest Regressor**  
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**  
3. **Linear Regression**  
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Hyperparameter Tuning**  

## Results & Visualizations
- **Model Comparison**: Table & Bar plots visualizing MAE and R² scores.

- ## 📌 Why This Project Matters

Real estate pricing is complex, with prices influenced by multiple factors such as location, square footage, and market trends. This model provides **data-driven insights** for:

- **Real Estate Investors**: Helps estimate property values for better investment decisions.  
- **Home Buyers & Sellers**: Assists in determining fair market value based on historical sales data.  
- **Real Estate Agents & Analysts**: Supports pricing strategies and trend forecasting.  

By leveraging **machine learning**, this project enhances the accuracy of price predictions beyond traditional comparative market analysis.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
To improve performance and usability, future iterations of this project could include:
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Pulling in live MLS listings for up-to-date predictions.  
- **More Features**: Including interest rates, HOA fees, proximity to attractions/schools/shopping centers, and neighborhood crime statistics.  
- **Web App Deployment**: Creating a user-friendly web interface where users can input condo details and get instant price predictions.
